## Simulated Transactions Analysis Workbook
# Evaluating Customer Value on Simulated Data Using Excel 
***

## What is This Excel Workbook?

<p> This excel workbook can be used to evaluate customer value using a variant of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on a dynamic simulated transactions table. The user can specify parameters such as number of transactions, shape and scale of
distributions used to generate the data, and RFM weights. The workbook contains macros which are used to simulate the data according to the user
specified values.
</p>

## Structure and Content of This Workbook 

<p>
This workbook contains two sheets: <i>Simulated Transaction Data</i> and <i>Customer Profiles</i>.
</p>

# The Simulated Transaction Data sheet

This sheet consists of a table of simulated transactions data, boxes for specifying transactions amount and customer id distribution parameters, a box for specifying the number of 
transactions to be used in the simulation, histograms for the distributions
of transactions amounts and customer ids, and also two buttons for populating
or re-populating the columns of the table with data depending on the parameters entered in the boxes. The columns in the transaction table are:
</p>

<p><ul><li> <b>Transaction ID</b> Unique ID numbers from 9121300 to 9121300 +  number of transactions
</li></ul></p>
<p><ul><li> <b>Random Numbers</b> Random numbers from the range (0,1)
</li></ul></p>
<p><ul><li> <b>Old CustomerID</b> All integers from 1-600 are included at the top of the column for completeness and then the integers are generated from the gamma distribution
</li></ul></p>
<p><ul><li> <b>CustomerID</b> Random reordering of the Old CustomerID column. This is used so numbers closer together do not necessarily have similar frequency (because of how the data is generated by the gamma distribution)
</li></ul></p>
<p><ul><li> <b>Transaction Date</b> Random dates between 1/1/17 and 2/1/19
</li></ul></p>
<p><ul><li> <b>Transaction Amount</b> Random transaction amounts sampled from the gamma distribution. The lowest price transaction is assured to be no less than $3.00
</li></ul></p>
